## Building a basic population model

```{r}
# load the aae.pop package
library(aae.pop)

# create a basic Leslie matrix for a population with
#   five age classes
# the aae.pop package assumes "columns move to rows"
popmat <- rbind(
  c(0,    0,    2,    4,    7),  # reproduction from 3-5 year olds
  c(0.25, 0,    0,    0,    0),  # survival from age 1 to 2
  c(0,    0.45, 0,    0,    0),  # survival from age 2 to 3
  c(0,    0,    0.70, 0,    0),  # survival from age 3 to 4
  c(0,    0,    0,    0.85, 0)   # survival from age 4 to 5
)

# create a population dynamics object with this matrix
#   without any additional processes
popdyn <- dynamics(popmat)

# simulate from this model with default (random) initial conditions
sims <- simulate(popdyn)

```
