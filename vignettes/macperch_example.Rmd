## Introduction

This example builds a model of Macquarie perch population dynamics to illustrate several advanced features of `aae.pop`. Specifically, this example demonstrates the use of multiple `args` terms in `simulate`, complex forms of density dependence, and the use of the `args.fn` option in `simulate`.

Demonstrate density_dependence_n and stocking or fishing effects.

Demonstrate positive density dependence.

Demonstrate environmental stochasticity with update_binomial and args.dyn.
