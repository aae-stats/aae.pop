```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(aae.pop)
```

## Installation and setup

You can install the `aae.pop` package from GitHub. To install from GitHub, you'll need the `remotes` R package, which you can install from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

You can then install the `aae.pop` package from Github with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("aae-stats/aae.pop")
```

Once completed, you should be able to load the 
`aae.pop` package with `library(aae.pop)`.

## Background

### Population models

The `aae.pop` package requires elementary knowledge of population models. A comprehensive reference is Hal Caswell's *Matrix Population Models* (2nd edition, 2001, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland). Searching for examples of *population viability analysis*, *population demographic models*, or *matrix population models* will bring up many alternative references.

### Matrix structures

`aae.pop` is designed for generic matrix models and makes minimal assumptions about model structure or purpose. However, there are still some assumptions built into the different functions and documentation. The most important is the layout of the population matrix itself. `aae.pop` assumes that *columns move to rows*. For example, a value in the second row and first column of a matrix will specify a transition from stage 1 (column 1) to stage 2 (row 2), that is, column 1 moves to row 2. This is a common layout in population ecology but is not standard in all disciplines.

There are two population structures used frequently in population ecology: the *Leslie matrix* (age based) and the *Lefkovitch matrix* (life-stage based). A Leslie matrix classifies into age classes, with transitions restricted to reproduction or survival to the next age class. A Lefkovitch matrix classifies individuals into life stages, with transitions restricted to reproduction, survival to the next life stage, or survival but remaining in the same life stage. `aae.pop` includes several helper functions designed specifically for these two model types. These are described in the [Including processes](including_processes.html) and [Beyond defaults](beyond_defaults.html) vignettes.

### Terminology

`aae.pop` uses three terms to help specify common model structures: *reproduction*, *survival*, and *transition*. These are defined as follows:

- reproduction: any transition to the first class (first row), assumed to exclude the first column (i.e., new individuals can't reproduce).

- survival: remaining in the same class.

- transition: moving to the next age class or life stage.

With these terms, a Leslie matrix has reproduction and transition elements, whereas a Lefkovitch matrix has reproduction, transition, and survival elements.

Of course, matrix population models can have values anywhere in a matrix, and `aae.pop` supports any models represented as a square matrix. This flexibility is important because some populations might require complex structures to deal with things like metapopulations, dormant stages, or size-based models with shrinkage as well as growth.


## Building a basic population model

The central functions in `aae.pop` are `dynamics` and `simulate`. The `dynamics` function wraps up a population matrix and any specified processes into a single object. The `simulate` function takes this object and generates population projections.

### The population matrix

A good place to start is with a basic population matrix and no other processes. For example, a Leslie matrix with five age classes can be specified as:

```{r}
popmat <- rbind(
  c(0,    0,    2,    4,    7),  # reproduction from 3-5 year olds
  c(0.25, 0,    0,    0,    0),  # survival from age 1 to 2
  c(0,    0.45, 0,    0,    0),  # survival from age 2 to 3
  c(0,    0,    0.70, 0,    0),  # survival from age 3 to 4
  c(0,    0,    0,    0.85, 0)   # survival from age 4 to 5
)
```

Using the terminology above, this same matrix could be specified as:

```{r}
new_offspring <- c(2, 4, 7)
transition_probabilities <- c(0.25, 0.45, 0.70, 0.85)
popmat <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
popmat[reproduction(popmat, dims = 3:5)] <- new_offspring
popmat[transition(popmat)] <- transition_probabilities
```

Although this looks fairly unwieldy in this case, these helper terms can be useful with large matrices.

### Creating a population `dynamics` object

Once the population matrix is defined, it can be compiled into a `dynamics` object with the following code:

```{r}
popdyn <- dynamics(popmat)
```

It is possible to plot the population dynamics object to visualise the transitions and structure this implies. This requires the `DiagrammeR` package. Visualising population structures can be a useful way to check the model has been specified correctly, and these plots are easier to communicate than a giant matrix.

```{r}
plot(popdyn)
```

### Simulating population trajectories

With a compiled `dynamics` object, it's relatively straightforward to simulate some population trajectories (with default settings):

```{r}
sims <- simulate(popdyn)
```

Simulated trajectories can be plotted using the standard `plot` function in R. This example sets the colour to a medium shade of blue:

```{r, dev = "png"}
plot(sims, col = "#2171B5")
```

### Changing default settings

The default settings simulate a single trajectory with 50 time steps, from random initial conditions (Poisson draws with $\lambda = 10$). These settings can be changed directly in the call to `simulate`:

```{r, dev = "png"}
initials <- c(100, 50, 20, 10, 5)  # some initial conditions
sims <- simulate(popdyn,
                 nsim = 100,
                 init = initials,
                 options = list(ntime = 20))
```

Default settings also specify that population updates are calculated as a cross product and that abundances are not rounded in any way in each step, which allows fractional individuals in the population. These are not ideal settings. Changing them is covered in the [Beyond defaults](beyond_defaults.html) vignette.

### Summarise simulated trajectories

Simulated trajectories are arrays with dimensions of replicates (rows) by classes (columns) by time steps (slices). These arrays are relatively easy to summarise using `apply` functions but the `aae.pop` package includes several basic summary functions for convenience.

A simple summary of the probability a population will hit zero individuals at any time step, plus expected minimum population size (EMPS), is generated with the `summary` function. This summary makes most sense when considering replicate population trajectories because extinction probabilities are defined as the proportion of trajectories hitting zero individuals:

```{r}
sims <- simulate(popdyn, nsim = 1000)
summary(sims)
```

The vector printed at the bottom of this summary is a basic risk curve calculated from ten different extinction thresholds (described below).

The components of this summary are directly accessible:

```{r}
pr_extinct(sims)
emps(sims)
risk_curve(sims, n = 10)
```

The default settings for `pr_extinct`, `emps`, and `risk_curve` consider all population classes, all time steps, and define extinction as zero individuals in the population. Many applications require more-nuanced definitions. All three functions can be calculated for a subset of the population (e.g., adults) and for a reduced time period (e.g., generations 40-50).

```{r}
pr_extinct(sims, subset = 3:5, times = 40:50)
emps(sims, subset = 3:5, times = 40:50)
risk_curve(sims, subset = 3:5, times = 40:50, n = 10)
```

Extinction can be defined at levels other than zero individuals. For example, a population might be considered functionally extinct or destined to become extinct when only 100 adults remain. This *quasi-extinction* threshold is controlled with the `threshold` parameter to `pr_extinct`:

```{r}
pr_extinct(sims, threshold = 100, subset = 3:5, times = 40:50)
```

Risk curves are an extension of the previous idea and consider probabilities of population declines below multiple thresholds simultaneously. The `summary` function calculates a basic risk curve with ten thresholds spaced evenly between zero and the maximum observed abundance. More commonly, risk curves focus on multiple levels and might represent categories such as extreme, high, moderate, mild, and no risk. These values could be based on many criteria but often consider genetic factors such as the risk of inbreeding.

```{r}
risk_curve(sims, threshold = c(0, 10, 50, 100, 1000))
```

The `emps` function extracts the minimum population size within each replicate trajectory and then averages these values over all trajectories. This averaging defaults to an arithmetic mean but this can be changed to any function using the `fun` argument (see `?emps` for details). A generalisation of this calculation is provided with the `exps` function, where *x* represents an unknown function in place of the minimum. With few exceptions, `emps` and `exps` require summary functions that return single values (scalars). Even with this restriction, `exps` allows flexible calculations to calculate many different summary statistics. For example, it might be informative to calculate the 95th percentile of each trajectory and then take the median of this over all trajectories:

```{r}
exps(sims, fun_within = quantile, fun_among = median, probs = 0.95)
```

The above summary functions are provided for convenient handling of details such as subsetting the population or time steps. More complicated functions could be implemented directly with the `apply` function and the output `simulation` object. An example is the median population size at each time step:

```{r}
# subset the population to adults 
sims <- subset(sims, subset = 3:5)

# drop the first 10 generations (the drop = FALSE
#   argument is a safeguard that keeps the third array
#   dimension when filtering to a single time step)
sims <- sims[, , 11:51, drop = FALSE]

# sum abundances over all classes, which
#   gives a matrix (2D array) with replicates
#   in rows and time steps in columns
abundance <- apply(sims, c(1, 3), sum)

# and calculate median over all trajectories, which
#   requires keeping the second dimension (time steps)
#   while iterating over the first
apply(abundance, 2, median)
```
