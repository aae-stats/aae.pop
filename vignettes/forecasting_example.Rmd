## Introduction

This example uses a simplified model of population dynamics to demonstrate the generation of short-term forecasts specifically for the purposes of prediction and model validation. Forecasting in this way is an underused tool in the ecologist's toolbox, but is an incredibly effective way to improve model predictions and ecological knowledge.
