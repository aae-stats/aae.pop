```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

Cover the importance of checking model outputs and how this can be done.

Link to forecasting example for more rigorous checks.

Could highlight statistical tests and checks but these are an extension.

```{r}
a <- rnorm(10)
```
