# Forecasting population dynamics

## Introduction

This example uses a simplified model of population dynamics to
demonstrate the generation of short-term forecasts specifically for the
purposes of prediction and model validation. Forecasting in this way is
an underused tool in the ecologist’s toolbox, but is an incredibly
effective way to improve model predictions and ecological knowledge.
