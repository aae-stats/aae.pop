\title{Specify environmental and demographic stochasticity in models of
  population dynamics}
\usage{
environmental_stochasticity(masks, funs)

demographic_stochasticity(masks, funs)
}
\arguments{
\item{masks}{a logical matrix or vector (or list of these)
defining cells affected by \code{funs}. See Details and
\code{\link{masks}}}

\item{funs}{a function or list of functions with one element
for each element of \code{masks}. See Details}
}
\value{
\code{environmental_stochasticity} or
  \code{demographic_stochasticity} object specifying the way in which
  stochasticity should be included in a matrix population model;
  for use with \code{\link{dynamics}}
}
\description{
Specify environmental stochasticity (random variation
  in vital rates) and demographic stochasticity (random variation
  in population outcomes).
}
\details{
Masks must be of the same dimension as the population
  dynamics matrix (in the case of environmental stochasticity)
  or have one element for each class (in the case of demographic
  stochasticity). Masks specify cells influenced by stochasticity
  according to \code{funs}. Additional details on masks are provided
  in \code{\link{masks}}.

  Functions must have at least one argument, a population
  dynamics matrix for environmental
  stochasticity or a vector of population abundances for
  demographic stochasticity. Functions must return an
  output of the same dimensions as the input,
  modified to reflect the effects of stochasticity on
  vital rates or population abundances.

  Additional arguments to functions are supported and can be
  passed to \code{\link{simulate}} with the \code{args},
  \code{args.dyn}, or \code{args.fn} arguments.

# define a population matrix (columns move to rows)

# and plot
plot(sims)

# note that there is only one trajectory now because
#   this simulation is deterministic.
#
# let's change that by adding some environmental stochasticity

  masks = list(
    reproduction(popmat, dims = 4:5),
    transition(popmat)

# the rmultiunit draws can be slow but we can speed
#   this up by calculating them once per generation
#   instead of once per replicate within each generation
envstoch <- environmental_stochasticity(
  masks = list(
    reproduction(popmat, dims = 4:5),
    transition(popmat)
  ),
  funs = list(
    function(x, ...) rpois(n = length(x), lambda = x),
    function(x, mean, sd) {
      pnorm(mean + sd * rnorm(length(x)))
    }
  )
)

# this requires an argument "function" that takes the
#   current state of the population model in each
#   iteration and calculates the correct arguments to
#   pass to environmental_stochasticty
envstoch_function <- function(obj, pop, iter) {
  mat <- obj$matrix

# a simple way to add demographic stochasticity is to change
#   the "updater" that converts the population at time t
#   to its value at time t + 1. The default in aae.pop
#   uses matrix multiplication of the vital rates matrix
#   and current population. A simple tweak is to update
#   with binomial draws. Note that this also requires a
#   change to the "tidy_abundances" option so that population
#   abundances are always integer values.
