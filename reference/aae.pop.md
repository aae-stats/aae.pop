# aae.pop: flexible simulation of multispecies population dynamics

aae.pop supports flexible specification of population dynamics with
tools for simulating single and multispecies dynamics, including in
metapopulation structures.

See
[`dynamics`](https://aae-stats.github.io/aae.pop/reference/dynamics.md)
and
[`simulate`](https://aae-stats.github.io/aae.pop/reference/simulate.md)
for detailed examples of model definition and simulation.
