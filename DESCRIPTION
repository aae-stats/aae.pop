Description: Simulate population dynamics from realistically complex matrix
    population models in a plug-and-play fashion. Supports aspatial and 
    spatially implicit models with one or more species and time-varying
    covariates, stochasticity, density dependence, additions or removals of
    indidivuals, interspecific interactions, and metapopulations.
